Please do not edit the main.c. only edit in your own modules. everything has already been set up. 
you only need to call for the head for link list and arr for array.
do not for get to make a temporary link list for it. 

when adding a commit. just click on your file (.c file) and click edit (pen icon top right corner).
just copy paste your code. that's it.
do not also forget to write a commit change, meaning enter what you edited in your code. 
you may also write a detailed changes under the first text box. 

if you want to display data use displayLL() for link list and displayArr() for array.
do not use DataGen() it is only for Generating Data for the list ONCE.

displaying your own UI should start at x = 10, y = 6. 
meaning 10 spaces in x-axis and 6 new lines in y-axis before printing something. 

when compiling, make sure you are on main.c or else it will fail.
